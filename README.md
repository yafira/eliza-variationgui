This is an extended version of the Eliza chat that uses a series of questions to find out more information about the user by using the longest and shortest words from the entire session to form a random assesment sentence. Everything is logged in a file, and can be displayed in the GUI after 1 session has been completed. The longest words from each answer can be displayed in the order in which they were provided by the user and logged into the file. They can also be sorted and displayed alphabetially. The program will exit by clicking the corner X on the application window or entering the "end session" button. This project focuses on Strings, Arrays, File I/O, Exceptions, GUI (Graphic User Interface).
